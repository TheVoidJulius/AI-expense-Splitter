## How It Works

### Adding an expense

Send a POST request to `/add-expense` with:

```json
{
  "payer": "Alice",
  "amount": 900,
  "participants": ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol"],
  "desc": "Dinner",
  "category": "Food"
}
```

### API Routes

| Method | Route | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| GET | `/` | Loads the UI |
| GET | `/expenses` | Returns all expenses |
| POST | `/add-expense` | Adds a new expense |
| DELETE | `/delete-expense/<index>` | Deletes an expense by index |
| GET | `/balances` | Returns net balance per person |
| GET | `/settlements` | Returns minimum transactions to settle up |

## Settlement Algorithm

Uses a greedy algorithm to minimize the number of transactions:

1. Calculates net balance for each person (positive = owed money, negative = owes money)
2. Matches the largest debtor with the largest creditor
3. Repeats until all debts are settled

---

## Example

Three friends share expenses:
- Alice pays ₹900 for dinner (split 3 ways)
- Bob pays ₹300 for transport (split 3 ways)

**Balances:**
- Alice: +₹600
- Bob: +₹200
- Carol: -₹400

**Settlement:**
- Carol pays Alice ₹400 ✓
